# node-gearman

**node-gearman** is an extremely simple Gearman client/worker module for Node.JS. You can register workers and you can submit jobs, that's all about it.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/andris9/node-gearman.png)](http://travis-ci.org/andris9/node-gearman)

**NB!** Breaking API change - `'connected'` events etc are now called `'connect'`.

## Installation

Install through *npm*

    npm install node-gearman

## Usage

See [examples](https://github.com/andris9/node-gearman/tree/master/examples) folder for sample scripts

## Connect to a Gearman server

Set up connection data and create a new `Gearman` object

    var Gearman = require("node-gearman");
    var gearman = new Gearman(hostname, port);

Where `hostname` defaults to `"localhost"` and `port` to `4730`

This doesn't actually create the connection yet. Connection is created when needed but you can force it with `gearman.connect()`

    var gearman = new Gearman(hostname, port);
    gearman.connect();

## Connection events

The following events can be listened for a `Gearman` object:

  * **connect** - when the connection has been successfully established to the server
  * **idle** - when there's no jobs available for workers
  * **close** - connection closed
  * **error** - an error occured. Connection is automatically closed.

Example:

    var gearman = new Gearman(hostname, port);
    gearman.on("connect", function(){
        console.log("Connected to the server!");
    });
    gearman.connect();

## Submit a Job

Jobs can be submitted with `gearman.submitJob(name, payload)` where `name` is the name of the function and `payload` is a string or a Buffer. The returned object (Event Emitter) can be used to detect job status and has the following events:

  * **error** - if the job failed, has parameter error
  * **data** - contains a chunk of data as a Buffer
  * **end** - when the job has been completed, has no parameters
  * **timeout** - when the job has been canceled due to timeout

Example:

    var gearman = new Gearman(hostname, port);
    var job = gearman.submitJob("reverse", "test string");

    job.on("data", function(data){
        console.log(data.toString("utf-8")); // gnirts tset
    });

    job.on("end", function(){
        console.log("Job completed!");
    });

    job.on("error", function(error){
        console.log(error.message);
    });

## Setup a Worker

Workers can be set up with `gearman.registerWorker(name, callback)` where `name` is the name of the function and `callback` is the function to be run when a job is received.

Worker function `callback` gets two parameters - `payload` (received data as a Buffer) and `worker` which is a helper object to communicate with the server. `worker` object has following methods:

  * **write(data)** - for sending data chunks to the client
  * **end([data])** for completing the job
  * **error()** to indicate that the job failed

Example:

    var gearman = new Gearman(hostname, port);

    gearman.registerWorker("reverse", function(payload, worker){
        if(!payload){
            worker.error();
            return;
        }
        var reversed = payload.toString("utf-8").split("").reverse().join("");
        worker.end(reversed);
    });

## Job timeout

You can set an optional timeout value (in milliseconds) for a job to abort it automatically when the timeout occurs.

Timeout automatically aborts further processing of the job.

    job.setTimeout(timeout[, timeoutCallback]);

If `timeoutCallback` is not set, a `'timeout'` event is emitted on timeout.

    job.setTimeout(10*1000); // timeout in 10 secs
    job.on("timeout", function(){
        console.log("Timeout exceeded for the worker. Job aborted.");
    }); 

## Close connection

You can close the Geamrna connection with `close()`

    var gearman = new Gearman();
    ...
    gearman.close();

The connection is closed when a `'close'` event for the Gearman object is emitted

    gearman.on("close", function(){
        console.log("Connection closed");
    });
    
    gearman.close();

## Streaming

Worker and job objects also act as Stream objects (workers are writable and jobs readable streams), so you can stream data with `pipe` from a worker to a client (but not the other way round). This is useful for zipping/unzipping etc.

**NB!** Streaming support is experimental, do not send very large files as the data tends to clutter up (workers stream interface lacks support for pausing etc.).

**Streaming worker**

    gearman.registerWorker("stream_file", function(payload, worker){
        var input = fs.createReadStream(filepath);
        // stream file to client
        input.pipe(worker);
    });

**Streaming client**

    var job = gearman.submitJob("stream", null),
        output = fs.createWriteStream(filepath); 
    
    // save incoming stream to file
    job.pipe(output);
